# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a simple browser-based game built using **vanilla JavaScript** to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.
Instead of using libraries or frameworks, the goal was to build everything from scratch and understand how the logic works behind the scenes.
